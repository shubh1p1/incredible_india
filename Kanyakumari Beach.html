<p><h3><font color ="black" size ="5">   Ensconced in the southernmost part of India, the Kankyakumari Beach is settled at the confluence of the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean. Witnessing the varied hues of the waters of the three merging into one to form a unique palette is a surreal sight. It also has multi-coloured sand that makes the experience of strolling on it an unforgettably beautiful experience. However, the best reason to visit this beach is the spellbinding sunset and sunrise. Watch the sky painted in myriad hues as the sun dips or peeps out of the water. You can also shop for knick-knacks and local handicrafts at the beach. For a spectacular bird's eye view, you can head to the lighthouse on the beach. Tourists can also indulge in adventure activities and water sports at the beach and those looking for a quieter experience can trek down to the beach. The Kanyakumari Beach is located around 10 km from the heart of the city. It was earlier known as Cape Comorin.</font></h3></p>
