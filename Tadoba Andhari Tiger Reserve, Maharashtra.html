<p><h3><font color ="black" size ="5">   A haven for tiger lovers, Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve is one of the largest in Maharashtra. Comprising patches of dense forests, pretty meadows and deep valleys, it is one of the few tiger reserves in India where tourists can easily spot the tiger in its natural habitat. Lined with teak trees, the best way to explore the national park is by taking a safari in a gypsy. Other common sightings in the park include sloth bears, leopards, gaurs, nilgais, civets, striped hyenas, sambars, barking deers, chitals and wild dogs. Tadoba is divided into three forest ranges known as the Tadoba north range, Kolsa south range and Morhurli range. The forest is also home to a wide variety of reptiles including pythons and cobras.</font></h3></p>
