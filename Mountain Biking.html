<p><h3><font color ="black" size ="5">   There are several mountain biking trails across Leh-Ladakh. Adventure seekers can bike on Khardung La, which is considered to be among the highest motorable roads in the world, along the shores of Pangong Lake, through the Warila pass, in the Nubra Valley, and by the banks of rivers Indus and Zanskar. Several tour companies organise day-long or multiple-day biking tours for individuals and groups. Along the way, bikers are treated to local cultures, homestays and food. Since this is a strenuous activity, bikers must make sure they are fully acclimatised and in good shape before they embark on this adventure. Mountain biking is a great way to see the Leh-Ladakh region for those who like to ride and are up for the adventure in the mountains. Some companies may need visitors to prove they are fit for the adventure with short exercises or fitness certificates. The tours vary in their levels of difficulty.</font></h3></p>
