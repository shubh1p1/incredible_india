<p><h3><font color ="black" size ="5">   Gangotri is not just a delight for those on a spiritual quest but also for adventure travellers and trekking enthusiasts. One of the classic treks of the Garhwal Himalayas is the Gaumukh-Tapovan-Nandvan circuit. A great experience for both first-timers and experts, the trek passes through the Gaumukh glacier, which is the origin of the holy River Ganges.</font></h3></p>
<p><h3><font color ="black" size ="5">   The most preferred trek for tourists is the one to the Gaumukh from Gangotri. This is the spot where you will find River Ganges gushing out of a snout-like opening. For a seasoned trekker, the journey can be completed in around eight hours. The trek can get tricky at some points and the last few kilometres involve passing through a rocky terrain. However, a major part of the trek is fairly easy with few steep inclines.</font></h3></p>
<p><h3><font color ="black" size ="5">   The Gangotri-Gaumukh-Tapovan trail is rated as moderate, which means that both mountaineers and non-mountaineers can undertake the trek given they are in good health. You will pass through a number of beautiful glaciers like Gangotri, Meru and Kirti Bamak, on the way. The trek also gives an opportunity to witness some majestic peaks like Mount Shivling Peak, the Gangotri group of peaks and the Kedardome Peak. Stop at Bhojwassa for a panoramic view of the Bhagirathi group of peaks.</font></h3></p>
<p><h3><font color ="black" size ="5">   The Mount Shivling peak is one of the most amazing mountain peaks one can ever witness. Watching the mountain in its entirety from its base to summit at Tapovan is a blissful experience, which can be enhanced by camping at the point. If you are lucky, you will also get to see herds of blue mountain goats, known as bharal, grazing on the verdant mountains.</font></h3></p>
