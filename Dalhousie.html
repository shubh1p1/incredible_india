<p><h3><font color ="black" size ="5">   Perched atop a rocky ridge, with snow-clad Dhauladhar mountains and rolling emerald valleys adding to its natural beauty, Dalhousie, in Himachal Pradesh, is a quaint hill town perfect for a relaxing holiday. Lined with tall pine and deodar trees and dotted with pristine lakes and waterfalls, Dalhousie mesmerises you with its natural bounty. No wonder this secluded town was a favourite summer retreat of the British before Independence! The town preserves many remnants from its past and various quaint churches are a testimony to the colonial era. Dalhousie was named after the then governor general of British India, Lord Dalhousie, in 1854. Sprawling colonial-era buildings that are liberally scattered throughout the town, are a testament to Dalhousie's Victorian charm. Its beauty is further complemented by River Ravi flowing close by. This hill station also offers amazing views of the snow-capped Pir Panjal mountain range. Pines, oaks, rhododendrons and a number of other types of trees cover the mountain slopes. An ideal place to unwind, the hill station is a treasure of ancient temples, art, handicrafts and a rich cultural heritage that has been preserved since the 6th century. As you soak in the natural and architectural beauty, don't forget to sample the delicacies the town has to offer. From chha ghosht to patande, there's a lot on offer.</font></h3></p>
