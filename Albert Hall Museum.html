<p><h3><font color ="black" size ="5">   A magnificent building built in Indo-Saracenic architectural style, Albert Hall Museum (Central Museum) is located in Ram Nivas Garden. It draws its name from London's Victoria and Albert Museum. Its corridors are decorated with murals reflecting various civilisations. Currently, the museum houses a diverse range of wood crafts, stone and metal sculptures, metal objects, carpets, natural stones, arms and weapons and goods made out of ivory. The museum also displays art from the Kota, Bundi, Udaipur, Kishangarh and Jaipur schools of art. The building's foundation stone was laid during the visit of Prince of Wales, Albert Edward to Jaipur in 1876 and it was completed in 1887 by architect Samuel Swinton Jacob, the then director of Jaipur PWD.</font></h3></p>
