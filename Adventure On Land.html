<p><h3><font color ="black" size ="5">   Mountaineering is one of the major land-based activities in India that can be explored in several destinations in the country. There's the Beas Kund trail near Manali which begins at Solang Nallah and moves on to a pristine alpine lake, passing through meadows of Dhundi and Bakarthach. The Beas Kund lake is said to be where sage Vyas bathed during prayers and this journey is so celestial that locals say that even the trek is like a form of meditation! Then, there is the Gaumukh Tapovan trek, which takes about seven days to complete and covers the Gangotri glacier to the point that is said to be the mouth of the holy River Ganges. One of the best winter expeditions is the Har-ki-Doon trek in Uttarakhand. Meadows and pine forests abound with amazing views of the Swargarohini peaks as you climb your way up this trail on the western side of the Garhwal region. For lovers of nature, there is no better option than the Valley of Flowers for a trek amidst the colourful beauty of posies. Mid-July to August is when the flowers are in full bloom, making this approximately 38-km trek in Uttarakhand worth every step. Ladakh's Markha Valley trek traverses along the mighty River Indus for about eight days and passes through part lush and part barren landscape that is typical of the region. It is also a great journey for this who wish to bask in the Buddhist flavour of this land. There's also the trek up the mighty Kanchenjunga for those wishing for the ultimate adventure in the northeast Indian state of Sikkim!</font></h3></p>
<p><h3><font color ="black" size ="5">   In winter, the mountainscapes of India are draped with a blanket of snow, which is so thick in some spots that tourists use them as a makeshift ice rink, an ideal venue for snowy escapades. Auli, Gulmarg, Kufri and Solang in north India and the Yumthang Valley in northeast India offer you the chance to swish about on your skis in the snow! Some of these places have additional facilities for snowboarding and gondolas. </font></h3></p>
<p><h3><font color ="black" size ="5">   Another adventure activity is rock climbing. This can be enjoyed in north, west, and south India. In Karnataka's Hampi, you can go rock climbing while taking in the sights of an ancient UNESCO-listed rock and temple complex. Even Badami, in Karnataka, features ancient red sandstone rock cliffs that overlook the Agastya Tirtha water reservoir. Granite rocks in Ramnagaram also offer you the chance to climb their unique fissures and eroded topography. In western India, on the outskirts of Pune, are located various pitch climb locations that are made of basalt. It is best to climb here in winter. Spiti Valley in north India is another paradise on earth that provides intrepid rock climbers with the chance to climb its unique terrain thatâ€™s often termed as the Middle Land, meaning the land between Tibet and India.</font></h3></p>
<p><h3><font color ="black" size ="5">   There are very few adventure activities in the world that compare to the thrill and utter excitement of bungee jumping. Simply the act of stepping off a high cliff followed by complete free fall owing to gravity is enough to set anyone's heart racing. Fret not, the harness will ensure a smooth ride! The best place to do bungee jumping in India is the north Indian holy town of Rishikesh. Known not just for the holy Ganges that flows through it but also for its adrenaline-pumping activities, Rishikesh hosts India's highest bungee jump at about 83 m above ground level. It is also home to India's first giant swing that is similar to the bungee but feels more like a swing than a drop. These can be enjoyed at Bungee Jumping Zone, which also gives you a great view of the gurgling river below!</font></h3></p>
<p><h3><font color ="black" size ="5">   The limestone caves of Shillong, in Meghalaya, are great sites for experiencing caving. Some of the popular caves are Krem Mawsmai, Krem Mamluh, and Krem Umshyrpi. One can explore these to their heart's content and make memories that will last a lifetime.</font></h3></p>
