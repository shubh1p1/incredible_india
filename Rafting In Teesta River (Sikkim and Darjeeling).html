<p><h3><font color ="black" size ="5">   Darjeeling, with its lofty hills, challenging roads and gushing rivers is one of the best places in the country to indulge your adventurous side. The Teesta river that runs down the hills of Sikkim and Darjeeling for 172 km, is a hub for amazing water sports. One can find heaps of white sand alongside the river, particularly at the confluence of Rivers Teesta and Rangeet, which provide a major base for white water rafting. The large boulders around the river make it an ideal place for this sport. Both rivers have been declared safe for rafting, though they vary in intensity. Teesta is smoother, with smaller rapids and a slower flow. Therefore, it is better suited to amateurs and first-timers, looking only for a new experience. Rangeet on the other hand, is for seasoned rafters, with wild turns and fast-moving water that can be quite unforgiving if you don't know how to maneuver the raft.</font></h3></p>
