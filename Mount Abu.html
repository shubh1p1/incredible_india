<p><h3><font color ="black" size ="5">   About three hours away from Udaipur is Rajasthan's only hill station, Mount Abu, which rests 1,722 m above the sea level in the panoramic Aravalli range. One can reach here within three hours from Udaipur to enjoy the lake, waterfalls and exquisite Jain temples. At the heart of this popular tourists destination is the tranquil Nakki Lake. Legends say that the lake was dug by gods using nakh or nails; thus it's name. The lake is surrounded by green hills, well-laid-out parks and unique rock formations, including the Toad Rock, which resembles a toad about to hop into the water! The 14th-century Raghunath Temple stands near the lake's southern shore. Boating is one of the most popular tourist activities at the lake. Also popular is the sunset point on the hill, from where one can enjoy brilliant views of the setting sun.</font></h3></p>
<p><h3><font color ="black" size ="5">   The town is surrounded by the 289-sq-km Mt Abu Wildlife Sanctuary, which extends over most of the mountains. The place is also home to one of the finest Jain temples in the world, the Delwara temples. Built over several decades, these marble temples were constructed many centuries before the town was setup. Two of the temples are so intricately carved, they seem like have been constructed by divine hands. The first and the older one is Vimal Vasahi, on which work began in 1031, taking over 14 years to be completed. It is dedicated to the first tirthankar (Jain teacher), Adinath. The Luna Vasahi temple is dedicated to 22nd tirthankar Neminath and was built in 1230 and is said to have taken 15 years to be completed. In this temple, the marble has been so finely carved that at places it seems the stone has become transparent, letting light pass through!</font></h3></p>
<p><h3><font color ="black" size ="5">   Mount Abu also boasts the highest point of the entire Aravalli range called the Guru Shikhar, on which is located a temple dedicated to Dattatreya, who is considered to be the son gifted to sage Atri and his wife Anasuya by the Divine Trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh. Mount Abu is not only important in terms of its scenic locations but also in terms of religious values and architectural heritage.</font></h3></p>
