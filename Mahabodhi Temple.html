<p><h3><font color ="black" size ="5">   The Mahabodhi Temple Complex is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which lies about 115 km south of Patna, the capital of Bihar, and 16 km from the district headquarters of Gaya. The magnificent Mahabodhi Temple is one of the four holy sites related to the life of Lord Buddha, and marks the spot where he attained enlightenment. Standing in the middle of Bodh Gaya town, set amid lush green lawns, the iconic sandstone temple rises to a height of about 52 m. With intricate engravings and arch motifs on its shikhara (tower), it is a spectacular sight. Inside the temple, a gilded statue showcases Lord Buddha in his famous bhumisparsha mudra, with one finger touching the earth, asking it to witness his enlightenment. A chamber at the top houses a statue of Mayadevi, Lord Buddha's mother. The Mahabodhi Temple, destroyed in the 12th century was resurrected in the 14th century and excavated in 1811. It is truly a sight to behold. A pond near the temple that houses blooming lotus flowers is a particular attraction.</font></h3></p>
