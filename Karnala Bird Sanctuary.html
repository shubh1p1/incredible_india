<p><h3><font color ="black" size ="5">   A popular stopover for birdwatchers, the Karnala Bird Sanctuary lies at a distance of about 52 km from Mumbai. The biodiversity of the Western Ghats makes it a great habitat for birds and the sanctuary was especially favoured by renowned Indian ornithologist Dr Salim Ali. Its proximity to the Patalganga river and the richness of the woodland vegetation ensures that this park boasts an extremely diverse flora and fauna with over 150 species of resident and 37 species of migratory birds, which visit the sanctuary in winter each year. Around 23 water dishes made of cement are kept at strategic places to provide water to animals and birds. The Hariyal Nature Trail in the sanctuary offers great bird-sighting experiences, especially during the monsoon. For those seeking a more in-depth insight into the fascinating life of birds, the 6-km-long Mortaka Trail is an amazing spot with its fascinating array of bird and butterfly life. Apart from the many hiking trails and picnic spots, this sanctuary is also known for the Karnala Fort that rests on top of the hills. Located at an altitude of 445 m above sea level, this fort was built in the 12th century as a vantage point to govern the trade route between Bhor Ghat (a mountain passage in the Western Ghats) and Mumbai. At the bottom of the funnel hill of the fort there are 12 water storage tanks built with basalt rock to collect and retain rain water all around the year. The Karnala Bird Sanctuary is home to exotic bird species like the peregrine and shikra and also invites many trekkers who come here to escape the city and soak in the tranquility and isolation of this region.</font></h3></p>
