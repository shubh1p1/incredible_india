<p><h3><font color ="black" size ="5">   Located on the outskirts of Udaipur, Ahar, which looks like a city of tombs, is the cremation ground of the rulers of Mewar. Also a renowned archaeological site, Ahar has 372 cenotaphs of kings and queens of Mewar and was built over 400 years. Nineteen maharanas were cremated here, and the most striking cenotaph is that of Maharana Sangram Singh (1710 to 34). These cenotaphs are made of marble with fine carvings etched into them. The cenotaph of Sangram Singh has 56 pillars with an octagonal dome at the centre supported by eight smaller pillars. Nearby is a small museum with a rare collection of antiques. The archeological museum houses antiques that date back to the 10th century. Some of them include earthen pots, iron objects, etc. There is also a metal figure of Lord Buddha that dates back to the 10th century along with grain pots, skin scrubbers, balls and seals belonging to 1st century BC. </font></h3></p>
