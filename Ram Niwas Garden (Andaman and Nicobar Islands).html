<p><h3><font color ="black" size ="5">   Scuba diving is the greatest action on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The best months for diving are from December to April. One can enjoy the underwater marine life and view the rarest of corals by snorkelling and scuba diving at North Bay, Carbyn's Cove, Chidiya tapu, Havelock, Jolly Buoy, Redskin Island and Ross and Smith islands. The coastal belt surrounding these islands is the abode of one of the richest coral reef ecosystems in the world and most of this area is still untouched by human activity. Many of the islands are surrounded by reef fringes, often several hundred meters wide and are separated from the shore by a lagoon of even width. Cinque Island is one of the best diving sites in the islands, with its clear emerald waters providing a visibility of up to 80 ft. The deep dive offers views of a variety of marine life, including black coral, and is ideal for the experienced diver. For others, there are trainers who can help you get the hang of the sport.</font></h3></p>
