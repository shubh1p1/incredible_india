<p><h3><font color ="black" size ="5">   Feel like a bird as you paraglide over spectacular landscapes and survey nature's bounty laid out in splendour beneath you. Nandi Hills, located about 70 km from the city of Bengaluru, Karnataka, is a great spot for paragliding while enjoying picturesque mountain vistas. Bir Billing, in the state of Himachal Pradesh, is probably the best place to paraglide in India. It offers you the opportunity to glide high up in the sky for 15-30 minutes with trained tandems. The best time to do this is between October and June. The popular hill station of Manali also gives visitors a chance to paraglide amidst all the other fun things to do. In western India, paragliding is a popular activity near the Pawana Dam, in Maharashtra.</font></h3></p>
<p><h3><font color ="black" size ="5">   For thrill seekers, there's nothing more satisfying than skydiving. Tandem skydiving is a famed adventure sport across the world and there are two places in India where it can be enjoyed. The first one is the city of Deesa, in Gujarat, that was actually the first place to sanction sky diving in the country. The second is the city of Mysore (in the Chamundi Hills) in the Karnataka.</font></h3></p>
<p><h3><font color ="black" size ="5">   Last but not the least is hot air ballooning. With the sheer thrill and romance of gliding smoothly over historical, elegant, and charming cities of India, it invites tourists to holiday at a slower pace. Jaipur, home to regal palaces and forts, offers tourists a chance to explore their opulent riches from the sky. This adventure offers a unique perspective and gives a bird's eye tour of the famous city.</font></h3></p>
