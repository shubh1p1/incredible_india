<p><h3><font color ="black" size ="5">   Towering over the city of Bengaluru, Nandi Hills is a popular weekend getaway for city-dwellers and tourists. Covered in low-hanging clouds and shrouded by mist, Nandi Hills is a paradise for nature lovers and trekkers, who are enthralled by its breathtaking beauty and picturesque surroundings. The Nandi Hills View Point gives a sweeping view of the underlying scenery and makes for a great picture spot. You can also visit Tipu's Drop Point, which is perched upon a hill. It is said to be the place from where prisoners were pushed off by the army of Tipu Sultan, the ruler of Mysore. The point is also the best spot to enjoy a panoramic view of the Nandi Hills. Dating back to the 9th century, the Bhoga Nandeeshwara Temple, also known as the Nandi Temple is among Karnataka's oldest temples. It draws visitors for its splendid architecture and peaceful environment. History lovers can head to the summer residence of king Tipu Sultan, also known as Tashk-e-jannat. Build with wood, the temple is known for its beautifully carved arches, painted walls, high ceilings and pillars.</font></h3></p>
