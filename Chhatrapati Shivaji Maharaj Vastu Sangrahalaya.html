<p><h3><font color ="black" size ="5">   Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya, formerly known as Prince of Wales Museum, is a prominent art and history museum in India. Back in the 1900s, artists and general public started discussing the need to build a good cultural institution in Mumbai (then Bombay). The demands kept growing till finally a museum was established with public contribution aided by the then Government of the Bombay Presidency. An open competition was held in 1909 to choose the architect who would eventually design and build the museum. British architect George Wittet, responsible for designing many Mumbai landmarks, including the Gateway of India and Ballard Estate, won this competition. He was responsible for popularising the Indo-Saracenic style of architecture, which was a combination of Mughal and British architectural design sensibilities. This building is situated on the southern tip of Mumbai on the Crescent Site. The layout of this heritage structure also includes a well laid out garden that retains its original plan. The slender pillars inside the hall, the arched pavilion and the dome rising above the huge intersecting arches all come together to form a beautiful geometrical pattern. Small jaalis for light and ventilation add to the grandeur of the building. George Wittet skilfully incorporated the original wooden arched pavilion purchased from a royal house in Nashik, as a circular railing on the first floor of the building. The dome of this building is modelled on the the Gol Gumbaz of Bijapur and the finial is inspired by the Taj Mahal at Agra. The museum has a collection of over 50,000 artefacts comprising various forms of art from the Indian subcontinent and also from China, Japan and European countries. Additionally, it houses a study collection of natural history specimens. Amongst its more popular exhibits is a huge collection of Indian miniatures and other important antiquities, more particularly, the Maratha textiles and arms and armour from the collection of Seth Purshottam Mavji, a noted art collector. This collection was once a part of the treasures of Nana Phadnavis, the most influential minister during the reign of the Peshwas. A special highlight of the museum is its art and conservation centre, which specialises in heritage conservation and research.</font></h3></p>
