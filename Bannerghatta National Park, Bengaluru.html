<p><h3><font color ="black" size ="5">   Located on the outskirts of Bengaluru, Bannerghatta National Park is one of the few places around the world where wilderness is situated in close proximity to a metro city. The best way to explore the park is by taking a jungle safari in a bus. The safari takes you through different zones that shelter animals like tigers, elephants and sloth bears. Watching white tigers relaxing in their natural habitat makes for a truly thrilling experience. The Bannerghatta Biological Park is also known for housing the first-of-its-kind butterfly park in the country. While visitors can witness some beautiful butterfly species, the park also houses a museum that gives details about the life cycle of these beautiful creatures through pictures and video guides. A part of Bannerghatta National Park, it was started in 1972. In 2002, it was separated as an independent establishment.</font></h3></p>
